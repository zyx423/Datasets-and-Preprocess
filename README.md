# GCN datasets(Cora„ÄÅCiteseer and Pubmed) and some general figure datasets(ATT, COIL and Yale, etc.)
There are three classical graph datasets (cite, citeseer, pubmed)the graph convolution network(GNNs).
Besides, some figures datasets such ATT, COIL and IMM are also included in this file.
Moreover, I don't only provide the datasets but also offer the methods to preprocess those datasets.

These datasets can be used for many tasks such as clustering, classification and Link prediction, etc.
The datasets and methods are useful and friendly to the beginners.
