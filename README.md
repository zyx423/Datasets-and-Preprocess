# Datasets-and-Preprocess
The datasets for convention machine learning and Graph neural network
These datasets are often used in conventional machine learning articles such as 'att40','JAFFE', 'imm40','COIL20' etc.
Moreover, there are also some classical graph datasets, e.g., 'Cora', 'PubMed' and 'citeseer' which have been widely used in graph neural network. 
All datasets are in Matlab format.
